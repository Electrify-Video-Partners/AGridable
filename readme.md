**AGridable** is a Python library which makes formatting tables in your Dash 
app a breeze ðŸ’¨

It's a wrapper for the wonderful [Dash AG Grid](https://github.com/plotly/dash-ag-grid) 
library and enables users to quickly and easily apply formatting, without having to go through the (sometimes rather complex) process of configuration. 

For example, you can quickly and easily apply conditional colour formatting based on the range of values in a column.

The project was created by [James Laidler](https://github.com/lamesjaidler) 
whilst working at [Electrify Video Partners](https://electrify.video/).

# Quickstart

## Install Python Library

First, install the Python library (preferably into a virtual environment):

```base
pip install agridable
```

## Transfer JS and CSS files

**AGridable** relies on some standard Javascript functions and CSS formats; 
these can be found in the [assets](./agridable/assets) folder. You must either:

1) Copy these files into the assets folder of your site, or; 
2) If you already have versions of these files, append the functions and 
formats in these files to the relevant files of your site.

## Use AGridable

The best way to get started with **AGridable** is to look at the examples in the [examples](./examples) folder. These contain simple Dash apps that showcase how **AGridable** can be used to quickly and easily format a dataframe.

# Contributing to AGridable

Contributing to **AGridable** is actively encouraged; we'd love to see more functionality added to the library! For steps on how to contribute, see the [contributing doc](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
